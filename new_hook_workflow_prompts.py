"""
NEW HOOK-BASED WORKFLOW PROMPTS
===============================

Complete prompting flow for the new hook-based viral content analysis:

1. Profile Analysis (analyze 100 primary reels)
2. Hook Analysis (top 5 outliers for primary + competitors)  
3. Hook Generation (generate 5 hooks based on analysis)
4. Script Generation (create script for each hook)

Each prompt builds on the previous analysis results.

Generate exactly 5 powerful hooks that use EXACT competitor hook text but apply them to NEW subjects from the creator's unexplored content topics.

## Strategy
- Take the 5 analyzed competitor hooks 
- Keep the EXACT hook structure, wording, and pattern
- Apply each hook to a NEW subject from the creator's unexplored topics
- Do NOT reword or adapt the hook text - only change the subject matter
