# POST `/api/viral-ideas/queue` âš¡

Creates a new viral ideas analysis job and adds it to the queue.

## Description

This endpoint is the trigger for the core AI-powered viral ideas pipeline. It allows a user to submit a request for a new analysis based on their content strategy and a selected list of competitors.

The endpoint creates a new entry in the `viral_ideas_queue` table and links the selected competitors in the `viral_ideas_competitors` table. This new job will then be picked up by the backend processors for analysis.

## Request Body

The endpoint expects a JSON request body with the following structure:

```json
{
    "session_id": "unique_session_id",
    "primary_username": "user_profile",
    "content_strategy": {
        "contentType": "Educational",
        "targetAudience": "Beginner developers",
        "goals": "Increase brand awareness"
    },
    "selected_competitors": ["competitor1", "competitor2"]
}
```

| Field                  | Type             | Description                                             |
| :--------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `session_id`           | string           | A unique identifier for the user's session.             |
| `primary_username`     | string           | The username of the user requesting the analysis.       |
| `content_strategy`     | object           | An object describing the user's content strategy.       |
| `selected_competitors` | array of strings | A list of usernames for the competitors to be analyzed. |

## Execution Flow

1.  **Receive Request**: The endpoint receives a POST request with a JSON body containing the `session_id`, `primary_username`, `content_strategy`, and `selected_competitors`.
2.  **Validate Request Body**: The incoming JSON is validated against a predefined schema (e.g., a Pydantic model or a Nest.js DTO) to ensure all required fields are present and have the correct types.
3.  **Create Queue Entry**: A new record is created in the `viral_ideas_queue` table with the data from the request. The status is set to `pending`.
4.  **Link Competitors**: For each username in the `selected_competitors` array, a new record is created in the `viral_ideas_competitors` table, linking them to the new queue entry.
5.  **Send Response**: The endpoint returns a success message along with the ID of the newly created queue entry.

## Responses

### Success: 200 OK

Returns a confirmation object with the ID of the newly created queue entry.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "id": "queue_uuid_12345",

    },
