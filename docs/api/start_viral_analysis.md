# POST `/api/viral-ideas/queue/{queue_id}/start` âš¡

Starts a queued analysis job.

## Description

This endpoint is used to manually trigger the processing of a specific viral ideas analysis job that is already in the queue. It serves as a signal to the backend that the job is ready to be picked up by a processor.

It's important to note that this endpoint does not immediately change the status of the job to `processing`. The backend `viral_processor` is responsible for updating the status when it actually begins the analysis. This endpoint simply ensures the job is in a `pending` state and ready to go.

## Path Parameters

| Parameter  | Type   | Description                          |
| :--------- | :----- | :----------------------------------- |
| `queue_id` | string | The ID of the analysis job to start. |

## Responses

### Success: 200 OK

Returns a confirmation that the job has been successfully queued for processing.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "queue_id": "queue_uuid_12345",
        "status": "pending"
    },
    "message": "Analysis queued successfully - processor will start shortly"
}
```

### Error: 404 Not Found

Returned if the `queue_id` does not correspond to an existing job.

### Error: 500 Internal Server Error

Returned for any other server-side errors.

## Implementation Details

-   **File:** `backend_api.py`
-   **Function:** `start_viral_analysis(queue_id: str, ...)`
-   **Workflow:** This endpoint verifies that the queue entry exists and is in a `pending` state. The actual processing is handled asynchronously by a separate worker process, which will then update the job's status.
