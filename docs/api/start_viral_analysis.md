# POST `/api/viral-ideas/queue/{queue_id}/start` âš¡

Starts a queued analysis job.

## Description

This endpoint is used to manually trigger the processing of a specific viral ideas analysis job that is already in the queue. It serves as a signal to the backend that the job is ready to be picked up by a processor.

It's important to note that this endpoint does not immediately change the status of the job to `processing`. The backend `viral_processor` is responsible for updating the status when it actually begins the analysis. This endpoint simply ensures the job is in a `pending` state and ready to go.

## Path Parameters

| Parameter  | Type   | Description                          |
| :--------- | :----- | :----------------------------------- |
| `queue_id` | string | The ID of the analysis job to start. |

## Execution Flow

1.  **Receive Request**: The endpoint receives a POST request with a `queue_id` in the URL path.
2.  **Verify Job Status**: It queries the `viral_ideas_queue` table to find the job with the given `queue_id`. It verifies that the job exists and its status is `pending`.
3.  **Handle Invalid State**: If the job is not found or is not in a `pending` state, it returns an appropriate error (e.g., `404 Not Found` or `409 Conflict`).
4.  **Signal for Processing**: This endpoint does not directly start the processing. Instead, it acts as a signal to the backend worker processes that the job is ready to be picked up. The worker is responsible for changing the status to `processing`.
5.  **Send Response**: It returns a confirmation message that the job has been queued and will be processed shortly.

## Responses

### Success: 200 OK

Returns a confirmation that the job has been successfully queued for processing.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "queue_id": "queue_uuid_12345",
        "status": "pending"
    },
    "message": "Analysis queued successfully - processor will start shortly"
}
```

### Error: 404 Not Found

Returned if the `queue_id` does not correspond to an existing job.

### Error: 500 Internal Server Error

Returned for any other server-side errors.

## Implementation Details

-   **File:** `backend_api.py`
-   **Function:** `start_viral_analysis(queue_id: str, ...)`
-   **Workflow:** This endpoint verifies that the queue entry exists and is in a `pending` state. The actual processing is handled asynchronously by a separate worker process, which will then update the job's status.
