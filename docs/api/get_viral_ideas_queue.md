# GET `/api/viral-ideas/queue/{session_id}` âš¡

Retrieves the status of a specific viral ideas analysis job from the queue.

## Description

After creating a new viral ideas analysis job with the `POST /api/viral-ideas/queue` endpoint, the frontend can use this endpoint to poll for status updates. This allows for real-time feedback to the user, showing the progress of the analysis as it moves through the pipeline.

The endpoint returns a comprehensive status object, including the current stage of the analysis, the progress percentage, and the content strategy that was submitted.

## Path Parameters

| Parameter    | Type   | Description                                                                        |
| :----------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session_id` | string | The unique identifier for the user's session, which is linked to the analysis job. |

## Execution Flow

1.  **Receive Request**: The endpoint receives a GET request with a `session_id` in the URL path.
2.  **Query Database View**: It queries a database view called `viral_queue_summary`. This view is a pre-joined and aggregated representation of the `viral_ideas_queue` and `viral_ideas_competitors` tables, designed for efficient status lookups.
3.  **Handle Not Found**: If no record is found for the given `session_id`, a `404 Not Found` error is returned.
4.  **Send Response**: If a record is found, the data from the view is returned as the response with a `200 OK` status.

## Responses

### Success: 200 OK

Returns a detailed status object for the analysis job.

        "completed_at": null
    }

## Implementation Details

-   **File:** `backend_api.py`
-   **Function:** `get_viral_ideas_queue(session_id: str, ...)`
-   **Database View:** `viral_queue_summary` is used to efficiently retrieve the status and related data for the queue entry. This view likely joins the `viral_ideas_queue` and `viral_ideas_competitors` tables.
